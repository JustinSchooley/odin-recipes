        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
        A flat iron steak is a cut from beef 
        shoulder. Butchers remove the connective tissue to 
        separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts:
        One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is 
        less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice 
        among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is 
        wonderfully tender and juicy.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
            <li>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Place steak inside a large resealable bag. 
                Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, 
                chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and 
                mustard powder together in a small bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour marinade over steak in the bag. 
                Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. 
                Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes 
                on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 
                130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare. </li>
            <li>
                Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for 
                about 5 minutes before serving.
            </li>

        </ol>
